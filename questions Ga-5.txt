1. You need to clean this Excel data and calculate the total margin for all transactions that satisfy the following criteria:

Time Filter: Sales that occurred up to and including a specified date (Fri May 13 2022 21:49:50 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)).
Product Filter: Transactions for a specific product (Gamma). (Use only the product name before the slash.)
Country Filter: Transactions from a specific country (FR), after standardizing the country names.
The total margin is defined as:

Total Margin
=
Total Sales
−
Total Cost
Total Sales

Your solution should address the following challenges:

Trim and Normalize Strings: Remove extra spaces from the Customer Name and Country fields. Map inconsistent country names (e.g., "USA", "U.S.A", "US") to a standardized format.
Standardize Date Formats: Detect and convert dates from "MM-DD-YYYY" and "YYYY/MM/DD" into a consistent date format (e.g., ISO 8601).
Extract the Product Name: From the Product field, extract the portion before the slash (e.g., extract "Theta" from "Theta/5x01vd").
Clean and Convert Sales and Cost: Remove the "USD" text and extra spaces from the Sales and Cost fields. Convert these fields to numerical values. Handle missing Cost values appropriately (50% of Sales).
Filter the Data: Include only transactions up to and including Fri May 13 2022 21:49:50 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time), matching product Gamma, and country FR.
Calculate the Margin: Sum the Sales and Cost for the filtered transactions. Compute the overall margin using the formula provided.
By cleaning the data and calculating accurate margins, RetailWise Inc. can:

Improve Decision Making: Provide clients with reliable margin analyses to optimize pricing and inventory.
