# TDS Solver

## Project Description
This project is designed to make life easier for students enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course at IIT Madrasâ€™ Online Degree in Data Science. It provides an API that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions from the course.

## API Endpoint
The application exposes an API endpoint at:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/
```

### Request
The endpoint accepts a POST request with the question and optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.

Example:
```sh
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the 'answer' column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"
```

### Response
The response is a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer`.

Example:
```json
{
  "answer": "1234567890"
}
```

## Deployment
Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.
